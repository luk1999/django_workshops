# Introduction

## What is Django?
* One of the most popular Python web frameworks:
  * "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines"
  * "Batteries included"
* Full-stack framework
* First official version released in 2005
* Model-Template-View
* Supports Python 3.10+
* Latest version: 5.1 (Jan 2025)

## Pros
* Speedups development of your web app
* Great for MVP
* Quick start with just few CLI commands
* Built-in extensions (Auth, Admin Panel, Form Framework, Cache Framework, etc)
* A lot happens automatically under the hood
* A lot of 3rd party extensions that make development of app easier
* Scalability

## Cons
* It might be too heavy for projects like simple unauthorized API with few endpoints
* Might be not the best choice for apps that:
  * does a lot "under the hood" and just displays results
  * uses one or more non-SQL databases
* Easy to start with but not so easy to "master"
